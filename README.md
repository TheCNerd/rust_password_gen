# Rust Password Generator
## Please note that it doesn't work at the moment. Currently this is just a placeholder that just prints Hello WOrld. I'm working on the password generator on my local machine at the moment and will upload it to github when done.

Hello! I decided to remake the python password generator and rewrite it in rust
because I'm learning rust and I figured that this would probably be a good start.

If you wanna build this, you're gonna need cargo (what rust uses)

To build:
```
git clone https://github.com/TheCNerd/rust_password_gen.git
cd rust_password_gen
cargo build
```

The executable should hopefully be in rust_password_gen/target/debug/rust_password_gen
